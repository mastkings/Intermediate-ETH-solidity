## AccountManager Smart Contract

This is the first project in ETH-Proof-Intermediate, in this project I am tasked to create smart contract that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements.
# Overview

The AcountManager smart contract is a simple Solidity contract that demonstrates different ways of handling Account errors and exceptional conditions within a contract. It includes functions for depositing and withdrawing funds, as well as a function for dividing two numbers. Additionally, the contract showcases the usage of require, assert, and revert statements for Account Management.
